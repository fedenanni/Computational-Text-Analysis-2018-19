"and it cannot demonstrate with any credibility that its program is peaceful."	106	"1"
"The President is committed to using all instruments of national power to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons."	104	"1"
"When President Obama took office, Iran was ascendant in the region, and the international community was divided over how to address Iran’s nuclear violations."	107	"1"
