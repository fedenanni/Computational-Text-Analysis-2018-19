" Elected  officials  have overpromised  and  overspent,  and  now  the  bills  are due."	414	"4"
" Unless  we  take  dramatic  action  now,  young Americans  and  their  children  will  inherit  an  unprecedented  legacy  of  enormous  and  unsustainable  debt, with  the  interest  alone  consuming  an  everincreasing portion  of  the  country’s  wealth."	414	"4"

" Over  the  last  three  and  a half  years,  while  cutting  the  deflfense  budget,  the  current  Admincoistration  has  added  an  additional $5.3  trillion  to  the  national debt—now  approximately  $16 trillion,  the  largest  amount  in U.S.  history."	305	"3"

"Our  reform  of healthcare  will  empower  millions  of  seniors  to  control  their personal  healthcare  decisions,"	505	"5"
"unlike  Obamacare  that  empowered  a  handful  of  bureaucrats  to cut  Medicare  in  ways  that  will deny  care  for  the  elderly."	505	"5"
"We  must  also  change  the budget  process  itself."	414	"4"
"  From  its  beginning,  its  design has  enabled,  rather  than  restrained,  reckless  spending  by  giving  procedural  cover  to  Members  of  Congress."	414	"4"
" The  budget  process  gave  us  the  insidious  term “tax  expenditure,”  which  means  that  any  earnings  the government  allows  a  taxpayer  to  keep  through  a  deduction,  exemption,  or  credit  are  equivalent  to spending  the  same  amount  on  some  program. "	414	"4"
"It  also lumped  a  broad  range  of  diverse  programs  under  the heading  of  “entitlement,”  as  if  veterans’  benefits   and welfare  checks  belong  in  the  same  category."	505	"5"
" Far worse,  the  process  assumes  every  spending  program will  be  permanent  and  every  tax  cut  will  be  temporary."	414	"4"
" It  refuses  to  recognize  the  beneficial  budgetary impact  of  lower  tax  rates,"	401	"4"

" following  the  lead  of  33  States  which  have put  that  restraint  into  their  own  constitutions."	204	"2"
" We call  for  a  Constitutional  amendment  requiring  a supermajority  for  any  tax  increase,  with  exceptions for  only  war  and  national  emergencies,  "	204	"2"

"Inflation and the Federal Reserve"	NA	NA
"A sound monetary policy is critical for maintaining a strong economy."	414	"4"
"Inflation diminishes the purchasing power of the dollar at home and abroad and is a hidden tax on the American people."	414	"4"
"Moreover, the inflation tax is regressive"	401	"4"
", punishes those who save,"	414	"4"
"transfers wealth from Main Street to Wall Street,"	401	"4"
"and has grave implications for seniors living on fixed incomes."	706	"7"
"Because the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy actions affect both inflation and economic activity, those actions should be transparent."	303	"3"
"Moreover, the Fed’s important role as a lender of last resort should also be carried out in a more transparent manner."	303	"3"
"A free society demands that the sun shine on all elements of government."	201	"2"
"Therefore, the Republican Party will work to advance substantive legislation that brings transparency and accountability to the Federal Reserve, the Federal Open Market Committee, and the Fed’s dealings with foreign central banks."	303	"3"
"The first step to increasing transparency and accountability is through an annual audit of the Federal Reserve’s activities."	303	"3"
"Such an audit would need to be carefully implemented so that the Federal Reserve remains insulated from political pressures"	304	"3"
"and so its decisions are based on sound economic principles and sound money rather than on political pressures for easy money and loose credit."	408	"4"
"Determined to crush the doubledigit inflation that was part of the Carter Administration’s economic legacy, President Reagan, shortly after his inauguration, established a commission to consider the feasibility of a metallic basis for U.S. currency."	414	"4"
"The commission advised against such a move."	0	"0"

"a welcoming place to retire."	606	"6"
"It bespeaks the quiet pride of those who work hard to shelter their family and, in the process, create caring neighborhoods."	606	"6"
"Homeownership is best fostered by a growing economy with low interest rates,"	410	"4"
"as well as prudent regulation, financial education, and targeted assistance to responsible borrowers."	402	"4"
"The collapse of the housing market over the last four years has been not only a severe blow to the entire economy, but also a personal tragedy to millions of Americans whose homes have lost value and to so many others who have lost their homes."	408	"4"
"Combined with high unemployment, that decline has left countless homeowners saddled with mortgages exceeding the value of their homes."	408	"4"
"The response of the current Administration has done little to improve, and much to worsen, the situation."	305	"3"
"By discouraging private sector investment, it has stalled the housing recovery."	305	"3"
"Its massive intervention in the housing market, with the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac backing nearly all new mortgages, has hit the taxpayers with a bill for almost $200 billion to bail out the latter two institutions."	401	"4"
"It has spent billions more on poorly designed and ineffective housing assistance programs."	504	"5"
"Making matters worse, the Congress, under Democrat control, enacted the DoddFrank Act, a massive labyrinth of costly new regulations that deter lenders from lending to creditworthy homebuyers"	303	"3"
"and that disproportionately harms small and community banks."	401	"4"
"As a result, home sales remain weak, investment in housing remains depressed, construction industry jobs remain down, and mortgage lending has yet to recover to precrisis levels."	410	"4"
"Rebuilding Homeownership"	NA	NA
"We must establish a mortgage finance system based on competition and free enterprise that is transparent,"	401	"4"
"encourages the private sector to return to housing,"	401	"4"
"and promotes personal responsibility on the part of borrowers."	401	"4"
"Policies that promote reliance on private capital, like private mortgage insurance, will be critical to scaling back the federal role in the housing market"	401	"4"
"and avoiding future taxpayer bailouts."	401	"4"
"Reforms should provide clear and prudent underwriting standards and guidelines on acceptable lending practices."	303	"3"
"Compliance with regulatory standards should provide a legal safe harbor to guard against opportunistic litigation."	402	"4"
"Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were a primary cause of the housing crisis because their implicit government guarantee allowed them to avoid market discipline and make risky investments."	403	"4"
"Their favored political status enriched their politicallyconnected executives and their shareholders at the expense of the nation."	403	"4"
"Both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac should be wound down in size and scope, and their officials should be held to account."	403	"4"
"The FHA, tripled in size to more than $1 trillion under the current Administration, has crowded out the private sector and is at risk of requiring a taxpayer bailout."	303	"3"
"It must be downsized"	303	"3"
"and limited to helping firsttime homebuyers and lowand moderateincome borrowers."	504	"5"
"Taxpayer dollars should not be used to bail out borrowers and lenders by funding principal writedowns."	408	"4"
"While the federal government must prosecute mortgage fraud and other financial crimes, any settlements received thereby should be directed to individuals harmed by the misconduct, not diverted to pay for unrelated programs."	401	"4"
"FDIC insurance for bank depositors must be preserved."	414	"4"
"However, to correct for the moral hazard created by deposit insurance, banks should be well capitalized, which is the best insurance against future taxpayer bailouts."	408	"4"
"The federal government has a role in housing by enforcing nondiscrimination laws and assisting lowincome families and the elderly with safe and adequate shelter, especially through the use of housing vouchers."	503	"5"
"Homeownership is an important goal, but public policy must be balanced to reflect the needs of Americans who choose to rent."	504	"5"
